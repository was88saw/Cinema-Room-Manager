<p><strong>Reflection</strong> is a powerful feature in Java that allows a programmer to examine or modify the structure of a class at <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3609" target="_blank" title="In Java, a runtime, also known as runtime environment or runtime system, refers to the environment in which a Java program is executed. | It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets the bytecode of the program, and the Java Class Library, which provides a set of prewritten classes that can be used in Java programs. The runtime environment is responsible for managing system resources, loading classes, handling exceptions, and executing the code.">runtime</a>. That means a program can inspect and manipulate its own code, making reflection a useful tool for runtime code generation, testing, and more. </p>
<p>You can imagine it as something like black magic because it's possible to break several design principles using it. Most importantly, you can<strong> bypass <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3609" target="_blank" title="In Java, encapsulation is the practice of wrapping data and the methods that manipulate that data within a single unit, typically a class. | This allows for increased security and control over the data, as well as a more organized code structure. By hiding the implementation details of a class from the outside world, encapsulation promotes modular programming and reduces the risk of data corruption. Additionally, encapsulation can increase code readability and maintainability by providing a clear separation of concerns. Typically, a class does not expose its fields to other classes. Instead, it makes them accessible through special methods called accessor methods, also known as getter and setter methods. These methods provide encapsulation by allowing you to hide implementation details and control data access, ensuring security. According to the data encapsulation principle, a class's fields cannot be directly accessed from other classes. They can be accessed only through the methods of that particular class. To access hidden fields, programmers write special types of methods called getters and setters.">encapsulation</a></strong> by accessing member fields that are not exposed by its public API. In other words, it allows getting implementation details.</p>
<h5 id="javalangreflect-package">java.lang.reflect package</h5>
<p><strong>Java Reflection</strong> is implemented by the <code class="java">java.lang.reflect</code> package. Although <code class="java">java.lang.reflect</code> package includes many interfaces, classes, and exceptions, there are only four classes that you need to know at this level. These classes are:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Field</strong>: you can use it to get and modify name, value, datatype and <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3609" target="_blank" title="In Java, access modifiers are special keywords that specify who is allowed to use your code or a part of it. | They can be placed in front of any field, method, or class. There are four different access modifiers in Java: private, package-private (also known as default), protected, and public. The private access modifier is only accessible within the class itself. The package-private access modifier is accessible to classes from the same package. The protected access modifier is accessible to classes from the same package and any extending class. The public access modifier can be accessed from anywhere.">access modifier</a> of a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3609" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">variable</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Method</strong>: you can use it to get and modify name, return type, parameter types, access modifier, and exception type of a method.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constructor</strong>: you can use it to get and modify name, parameter types and access modifier of a constructor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modifier</strong>: you can use it to get information about a particular access modifier.</p></li></ul>
<h5 id="javalangclass">java.lang.Class</h5>
<p>There is another important point. You can't just achieve reflection only with the Reflect package that we've mentioned above. The Reflect package can give you information about a field, method or constructor of a class, but first you have to take the field list, method list, and constructor list. </p>
<p>This is possible with the <code class="java">java.lang.Class</code> class and its static <code class="java">forName()</code><strong> </strong>method. When you pass the name of any class to the <code class="java">forName()</code> method, it returns a <code class="java">Class</code> object that includes information about this class. </p>
<p>Another method which returns <code class="java">Class</code> object is <code class="java">getSuperclass()</code> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3609" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance method is a method that belongs to each object created of a particular class. | It can access fields of the specific object of the class. For example, if we have a class with two instance methods: method1() and method2(), and two objects: object1 and object2, the output of these methods will be different for each object because they have different values for the fields. To use an instance method, you must first create an object.">instance method</a>. This method returns a superclass of a <code class="java">Class</code> instance.</p>
<p>The <code class="java">java.lang.Class</code> also has several methods that you can use to get <strong>attributes </strong>(fields, methods, constructors) of the particular class you passed to <code class="java">forName()</code> method. Here are some of those methods:</p>
<ul><li><p><code class="java">getConstructors()</code></p></li><li><p><code class="java">getDeclaredConstructors()</code></p></li><li><p><code class="java">getFields()</code></p></li><li><p><code class="java">getDeclaredFields()</code></p></li><li><p><code class="java">getMethods()</code></p></li><li><p><code class="java">getDeclaredMethods()</code></p></li></ul>
<p>There are two important things to know about these methods.</p>
<p>First, each of these methods returns an array of objects from <code class="java">java.lang.reflect</code> classes. For example,  <code class="java">getFields()</code> returns an array of objects from the <code class="java">java.lang.reflect.Field</code> class. After that, you can use methods from <code class="java">java.lang.reflect</code> package to get further information about constructors, fields, and methods.</p>
<p>Second, <code class="java">getConstructors()</code>, <code class="java">getFields()</code> and <code class="java">getMethods()</code> return only public constructors, fields and methods from the class represented by the <code class="java">Class</code><strong> </strong>object. These methods also return <strong>inherited </strong>public fields and methods from <strong>superclasses</strong>.  </p>
<p>Similarly,<code class="java">getDeclaredConstructors()</code>, <code class="java">getDeclaredFields()</code>, <code class="java">getDeclaredMethods()</code> return all the constructors, fields and methods from the class represented by the <code class="java">Class</code><strong> </strong>object. These methods don't return inherited fields and methods from superclasses.</p>
<p>Usually, you can see developers use declared methods more often than non-declared methods. You will understand these things better with a practical example â€” let's take a look at one now!</p>
<h5 id="coding-examples">Coding examples </h5>
<p>Suppose that you have a class called <code class="java">Student</code>. It has three public fields, one <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3609" target="_blank" title="In Java, a protected field is a type of field that has protected access modifier. | This means that the field can be accessed within the same class, within the same package, and within the subclasses of the class, but it cannot be accessed from any other class outside of its package and not related through inheritance. This mechanism provides a way to encapsulate the implementation details of a class and control the data access, ensuring security and predictability of the code behavior.">protected field</a>, and a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3609" target="_blank" title="In Java, a private field is a field that is declared with the access modifier 'private', which restricts access to that field to the class in which it is declared. | This means that other classes, even if they are in the same package, cannot directly access or modify the private field of the class. By using the private access modifier, you can encapsulate the implementation details of a class and provide a controlled interface for other classes to interact with it. Private fields are typically not exposed directly to other classes. Instead, they are made accessible through accessor methods, also known as getter and setter methods. These methods provide encapsulation, which allows you to hide implementation details and control data access, ensuring security. According to the data encapsulation principle, the field of a class should not be directly accessed from other classes. Instead, the field can be accessed only through the methods of that particular class. To access a hidden field, programmers write special types of methods called getters and setters. Getters can only read the field, and setters can only write to the field. For example, a class may have four fields, each of which is declared as private to hide the field from direct access from other classes. The class may also have public getters and setters for accessing the fields through these methods.">private field</a>. It also has a default constructor and a public constructor. The <code class="java">Student</code> class also has a private method and a public method. </p>
<pre><code class="java">public class Student {
    public String firstName;
    public String lastName;
    public int age;
    protected String phoneNumber;
    private String accountNumber;
    
    Student(){
        System.out.println("This is default Constructor");
    }
    
    public Student(String firstName, String lastName){
        this.firstName= firstName;
        this.lastName= lastName;
        System.out.println("This is public Constructor");
    }
    
    private String sanitizeAccountNumber(String accountNumber){
        System.out.println("This is a private method to sanitize account number");
        //code to sanitize accountNumber goes here. 
        return accountNumber;
    }
    
    public void setAccountNumber(String accountNumber){
        accountNumber = sanitizeAccountNumber(accountNumber);
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The reflection process usually has three steps:</p>
<p>1. Get a  <code class="java">java.lang.Class</code> object of the class using the <code class="java">forName()</code> method. In this case, the class we want to reflect is <code class="java">Student</code>. </p>
<pre><code class="java">Class student = Class.forName("Student");</code></pre>
<p>2. Get the class attributes. In this case, we are interested in superclass, fields, constructors, and methods.  </p>
<pre><code class="java">Class superclass = student.getSuperclass();
Constructor[] declaredConstructors = student.getDeclaredConstructors();
Constructor[] constructors = student.getConstructors();
Field[] declaredFields = student.getDeclaredFields();
Field[] fields = student.getFields();
Method[] declaredMethods = student.getDeclaredMethods();
Method[] methods = student.getMethods();</code></pre>
<p>3. Get the information about class attributes and use it. In this case, we are going to retrieve the names of superclass, constructors, fields, and methods and print them.</p>
<pre><code class="java">System.out.println("Superclass " + superclass);

for (Constructor dc : declaredConstructors) {
    System.out.println("Declared Constructor " + dc.getName());
}
for (Constructor c : constructors) {
    System.out.println("Constructor " + c.getName());
}
for (Field df : declaredFields) {
    System.out.println("Declared Field " + df.getName());
}
for (Field f : fields) {
    System.out.println("Field " + f.getName());
}
for (Method dm : declaredMethods) {
    System.out.println("Declared Method " + dm.getName());
}
for (Method m : methods) {
    System.out.println("Method " + m.getName());
}</code></pre>
<p>You can write these three sections inside the <code class="java">main()</code> method and run this code. </p>
<h5 id="explaining-the-output">Explaining the output</h5>
<p>When you run the code above, you will get a superclass name, lists of constructors, fields, and methods: </p>
<pre><code class="java">Superclass class java.lang.Object
Declared Constructor Student
Declared Constructor Student
Constructor Student
Declared Field firstName
Declared Field lastName
Declared Field age
Declared Field phoneNumber
Declared Field accountNumber
Field firstName
Field lastName
Field age
Declared Method sanitizeAccountNumber
Declared Method setAccountNumber
Method setAccountNumber
Method wait
Method wait
Method wait
Method equals
Method toString
Method hashCode
Method getClass
Method notify
Method notifyAll</code></pre>
<p>You can see that <code class="java">getDeclaredConstructors()</code> has returned both constructors of the <code class="java">Student</code> class, while <code class="java">getConstructors()</code> has returned only the public constructor. Likewise, <code class="java">getDeclaredFields()</code> has returned all the fields of the <code class="java">Student</code> class, while <code class="java">getFields()</code> has returned only public fields.</p>
<p>Finally, we print the methods of the <code class="java">Student</code> class. As expected, <code class="java">getDeclaredMethods()</code> has returned both methods. Now the interesting part is that  <code class="java">getMethods()</code> has returned some methods other than <code class="java">setAccountNumber()</code> we've expected. If you remember, in one of our previous topics, we mentioned that the <code class="java">java.lang.Object</code> class is the superclass of all the classes we create. The <code class="java">Object</code> class has <strong>nine</strong> public methods, and all classes we create inherit<strong> </strong>those methods. That's why you can see nine extra methods in the output.</p>
<h5 id="risks-and-downsides">Risks and downsides</h5>
<p>While reflection offers powerful capabilities, it should be used with caution. Use it only when necessary, and when its benefits outweigh its potential drawbacks, which are:</p>
<ul><li><p>Performance overhead: reflection can add significant overhead to your program, requiring extra processing to inspect and manipulate the code structure at runtime. This can lead to slower performance, especially in large and complex applications.</p></li><li><p>Maintenance issues: reflection can complicate maintaining code, as the code's behavior can change dynamically at runtime. This can make it challenging to understand how the code is being used and manipulated, leading to compatibility issues and making it harder to update or change the code in the future.</p></li></ul>
<p>To minimize these risks, we recommend keeping reflection limited to specific, well-defined areas of the code, ideally, within frameworks and libraries, where it can be used to provide a high level of abstraction and make the code more flexible and reusable.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong> is a way to get information about or modify fields, methods, and constructors of a class. The <code class="java">java.lang.reflect</code> package and the <code class="java">java.lang.Class</code> class are essential in Java reflection.</p>
<p>There are three steps in the Java reflection process: </p>
<ol><li><p>Get the <code class="java">Class</code> object of the class that you want to reflect on.</p></li><li><p>Get the attributes of the class you want to reflect on as a list or array using <code class="java">java.lang.Class</code> methods.</p></li><li><p>Get information about the particular attribute you got during the second step using the <code class="java">java.lang.reflect</code> package.</p></li></ol>
<p>Reflection is an advanced concept that requires some knowledge of <strong>JVM </strong>and Java internal processes. Anyhow, we believe the information in this topic will help you start using reflection in your projects!</p>
